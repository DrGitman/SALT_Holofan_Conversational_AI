I had no interest in school but rather loved music but had no other choice to go to school. However, I had a rough school life as I was a very naughty kid. I was still fighting with the urge to leave school and go do music as I had a dream to become an artist just like Lil Wayne the American Artist. I got involved in fights frequently and I later got myself expelled from school as a result. My parents later gave up on me, as they too were tired of keeping up with me as a troubled kid. Later when I got to high school, I realized that music alone in Namibia is not going to take you far. I started to focus more on my schoolwork and developed more disciple in my life. When I reached grade 10 I started to lose focus again and was involved in substance abuse. However, I never gave up on myself while going through all the teenager moods and confusion. I never imagined myself going to a university but thank God I am enrolled at the university. Role model: My uncle who was a police officer always inspired me to finish school. I always thought that one day when I grow up I want to be like him. Many of my friends dropped out and are now forced to do unskilled work.
